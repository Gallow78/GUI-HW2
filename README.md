# GUI-HW2

Assignment 2 we were assigned to edit the CSS file to make the HTML file and web-page similar to the image provided. Overall I felt the assignment was straightforward and started by understand the HTML code and corresponding CSS code. Then went through section by section adding additional code in the CSS file. I had some trouble with having the nav properly line up with the rest of the of the web-page, but was able to resolve the issue with floating and margin adjustments.
